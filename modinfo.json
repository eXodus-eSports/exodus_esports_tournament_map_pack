  "description": "A hand-picked selection of the best maps the community has to offer. Maps are divided between 1v1, 2v2, 3v3+ and FFA. A multiplanetary tab has been added to help people using Shared Systems for Galactic War. The number of custom landing zones a system has is the maximum number of supported armies. Multiple players on a shared army count as one army. Some maps have recommended player counts as well.",
